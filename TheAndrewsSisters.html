		<h3>A picture of The Andrews Sisters</h3>

		<p>The Andrews Sisters were a popular trio, who peaked arounf World War II. They would perform for troops at home and abroad. Their most famous song, "Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy," was about a young man who was drafted. My personal favorite song of theirs, though, is a spin off of Gene Miller's legendary "In The Mood."</p>
