		<p>The Chordettes were one of the most famous female groups of their time. Their light jingles could get stuck in your head for days. You have definitely heard their most famous song, "Lollipop," which has morphed into a popular children's tune. One of my favorite songs by them is "Pink Shoe Laces."</p>
